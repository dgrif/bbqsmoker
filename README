ANOTHER ARDUINO BBQ SMOKER
==========================

This is going to be a temperature monitor inspired by this Homebrew Temperature Monitor/Controller project (http://hruska.us/tempmon/ and http://hruska.us/tempmon/BBQ_Controller.pde).  The first milestone is to build a temperature monitor thing that reads temperature from Maverick probes and displays them on an LCD with stats and stuff.  The second milestone is to adjust the temperature somehow (?).

I'm just a Java programmer with no electronics hardware experience.  There is a Fritzing schematic that shows the current state of the build.

Parts List
==========================
* Arduino Uno
* 1x Switchcraft TR2A Rev E 2.5mm jack
* 1x 22k resistor
* 1x Maverick probe

Notes:
==========================
* The Fritizing schematic shows a 3.5mm jack instead of a 2.5mm jack.  The 2.5mm jack (Switchcraft TR2A Rev E) has three connectors: #1 tip terminal, #2 shunt terminal, #3 sleeve terminal.  The #1 tip and #2 shunt terminals go to ground.
